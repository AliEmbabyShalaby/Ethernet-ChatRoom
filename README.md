**Ethernet Chatroom Documentation**

**Introduction:**
The Ethernet Chatroom is a Python-based project consisting of one server and multiple clients, facilitating real-time communication over an Ethernet connection. This documentation provides a brief overview of its key features and usage.

**Features:**

1. **Server-Client Architecture:** The project follows a classic server-client architecture, where the server can handle connections from multiple clients simultaneously.

2. **Client Authentication:** Clients connect to the server and provide unique usernames for authentication.

3. **Real-Time Messaging:** Authenticated clients can send and receive messages in real-time through the server.

**Setup and Usage:**

1. **Server Setup:**
   - Run the `server.py` script to start the server.
   - The server waits for incoming client connections.

2. **Client Interaction:**
   - Run the `client.py` script on separate terminals or machines for each client.
   - Connect to the server by entering the server's IP address and port number.
   - Provide a unique username when prompted.

3. **Chatroom Experience:**
   - Once clients are connected and authenticated, they can exchange messages in real-time.
   - Messages sent by one client are relayed through the server to all connected clients.

**Why It Matters:**
- The Ethernet Chatroom demonstrates network programming principles.
- It offers a platform for real-time communication and learning.
- It can handle multiple clients for group communication.

**Conclusion:**
The Ethernet Chatroom project enables real-time communication among multiple clients through a central server. It's a valuable tool for learning about network programming and can be further developed for various communication needs.
